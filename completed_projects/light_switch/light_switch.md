# Auto-Light Switch Toggler
In this project, I created a mechanical device that would flip the light switch at the press of a button. The body of the device was made out of 3D filament and I used an [Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense) for the microcontroller. I chose this microcontroller because it has built-in bluetooth, which allows me to communicate with the device wirelessly. I wanted to make this becuase sometimes when I'm tired and in bed, I don't have to get out of bed to turn off the lights.
