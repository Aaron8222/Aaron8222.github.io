# 3D Printed Utility Knife
During my first year of college, I started to work on a project to make my very own utility knife. There were two reasons for doing this 1) I wanted to learn how to using Solidworks to create complex multi piece designs and 2) Every mechanical engineer needs a utility knife!

## Sketching
I started by doing some quick sketches. I had a rough idea of what I wanted when I started this project, but I wanted to have something concrete and organized to make it easier to CAD. I wanted a simple mechanism to keep the knife blade safe so it could be 3D printed easily, so I decided to create a two pins that can be inserted into pinholes on either side of the knife. The pins and pinholes have a force fit, which keeps them from falling out.

## CADing

After getting some basic information, such as rough knife dimensions and blade dimensions, I began CADing the parts. I first created the large one piece body as can be seen below.

After creating this part, I made another copy of this and split it into two pieces as can be seen below.

Once I have the main body, I made an assembly with the blade to build a cover around the blade. After that was done, I created pins and pinholes for them.

## 3D Printing

For the print material, I chose ABS plastic because it is strong yet flexible. With the way I designed the cap insert, this allows for some degree of bending without breaking.

### Prusaslicer & Troubleshooting

The print took about 2 hrs and 30 mins with a infill of 15%. All of this was sliced in PrusaSlicer. While printing, there were a couple of times the print lifted off the heatbed. This was solved by adding a brim (a layer of material around a part to increase adhesion to headbed) and increasing the heatbed temperature to reduce contraction of material.

## Final Remarks

I enjoyed working on this project a lot. I have always wanted to make something that I can use and carry around with me. I am very happy with the end product. Next time, I might want to redesign it so that I could machine it out of metal instead. **Could have done differently, next steps, learning goals**
