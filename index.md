## About Me

I'm Aaron, a sophmore at Olin College of Engineering. My parents immigrated from China to the United States in the 2000s and started their own construction business before I was born. From an early age, I have been involved in the family business; starting with carrying light materials up stairs to operating excavators and administrator stuff. Growing up in this type of environment gives me a prospective many others have not experienced before. I learned the hardship of running a business. There are no set work hours when you are a business owner (or son of a business owner). I remember there were days when my Dad, brother, and I were sanding a wall, doing demo work or something else well after shifts have ended for the workers. Trying to balance all this on top of school work led me to develop a strong work ethic and time management skills. Growing up in this environment encouraged me to be curious about the world. I got to see every step of building a house. I got to see how the foundation was made, how each floor was built piece by piece, and how all the utilities were installed. These memories sparked questions like "Why does concrete harden after 8 hours and is so strong?" or "Why do we need this pillar in this spot?" or "What is this expanding foam that you spray on wood framing?" A few questions grew to more questions, which led to even more questions. This started a never-ending journey and thrist for knowledge about how the world works. This was the reason I chose to become a mechanical engineer. At Olin, I am free to explore a breadth of topics that are interesting to me such as fabrication, design, gears, welding, 3D printing, enthalpy, and dyanimic systems.
