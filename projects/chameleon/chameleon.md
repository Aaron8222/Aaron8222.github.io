# Chameleon Game
The goal of this project was to design and create a bio-inspired game for kids. As a team of 4, we decided to create a game based on the mechanisms of a chameleon! 

## Ideation and Sketching
We started by doing some research into chameleon behavior to see if there is something we can recreate. We found that a chamelon's eyes have the ability to move independently from each other, they can extend their tongue about twice the length of its body traveling from 0 to 60 mph in fractions of a second, and can change color. Below is a video capturing a chameleon's tongue in motion by National Geographic.

We found this mechanism very interesting and cool that we decided to make a game based on that.
