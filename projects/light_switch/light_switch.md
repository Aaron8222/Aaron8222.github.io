# Auto-Light Switch Toggler
In this project, I created a mechanical device that would flip the light switch at the press of a button. The body of the device was made out of 3D filament and I used an [Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense) for the microcontroller. I chose this microcontroller because it has built-in bluetooth, which allows me to communicate with the device wirelessly. I wanted to make this because I wanted a way to turn the lights off when I'm in bed.

## Sketching

I started by drawing some quick sketckes to give me a rough idea of how it would work and what it would look like. Once I got a good idea of what it looks like, I bought the necessary materials that I need to CAD, such as the arduino, servo, battery, battery springs, etc.

## CADing

After sketching, I started to make a CAD model in SolidWorks. I started by creating the servo, battery, and arduino model using a caliper.

### Mounts
Then I made the body to connect everything together. I started by creating the holes and dimensions of an acutal light switch cover and modified it fit all the components. 

**Battery Mount**
The battery mount had two main components to the battery holder. The first is a 3D printed housing for the battery springs and the other is the clips that hold the batteries in place.

**Arduino Mount**
The arduino monut was straightforward to cad. I began by extruding a box with the top open to store all the wires. Then I created a hole on the side to connect the servo and battery to the arduino.

**Servo Mount**
I created the servo mount by creating two identical towers in which screws can be attached to.
